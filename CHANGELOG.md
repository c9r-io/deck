# Changelog

## 0.4.30 — 2026-08-28

- Replace silent assumed-sent crash recovery with an explicit ambiguous
  delivery state and idempotent acknowledge/retry decisions.
- Keep dirty queue persistence retries alive after the last once item leaves
  the in-memory queue.
- Make card/project deletion contingent on successful tmux shutdown and a
  durable Board save; failures keep sessions visible and retryable.
- Fix sidebar Rename for non-active sessions and group sidebar sessions by
  Board, with Board order, counts, and stable waiting/running/stopped order.
- Route long-output copying through the native macOS clipboard, preserve exact
  text, report verified failures, prevent stale captures, and expose reliable
  20,000-row truncation metadata.
- Redact assignment, JSON, quoted and ANSI-wrapped paths, URLs and credentials
  throughout app logs, migrations and exports.
- Refuse to overwrite invalid JSON, malformed envelopes, wrong typed structure,
  or unreadable existing data; never poison a valid backup with damaged main
  bytes.

## 0.4.29 — 2026-08-28

- Added the long-output scrollback copy panel, strict schema-envelope checks,
  durable queue mutations, completion-bar placement fixes, and expanded log
  privacy protections.
